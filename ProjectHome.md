# Description #
HookME is a software designed for intercepting communications by hooking the desired process and hooking the API calls for sending and receiving network data (even SSL clear data). HookMe provides a nice graphic user interface allowing you to change the packet content in real time, dropping or forwarding the packet. It also has a python system plugin to extend the HookMe functionality.

It can be used for a lot of purposes such as:
  1. Analyzing and modifying network protocols
  1. Creation of malware or backdoors embebed into network protocols
  1. Protocol vulnerability memory patching
  1. Firewall at protocol layer
  1. As postexplotation tool
  1. whatever you can create with plugins using your imagination


# Plugins #
HookMe have a plugins system in Python. You can develop your own plugins or just download them from our repository, https://code.google.com/p/hookme/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fhookme%2Fhook%2FScripts

Also, if you want your script to appear here (it will contain your credits) you can contact us in hookmesoftware@gmail.com.

# Video Demo #
In this video we can see how to create a backdoor using hookme and python plugins that is injected into the mysqld.exe process allowing an attacker to execute remote commands
